\item The circuit shown in the figure is initially in the steady state with the switch K in open condition and $\overline{K}$ in closed condition. The switch K is closed and $\overline{K}$ is opened simultaneously at the instant $t = t_1$, where $t_1 > 0$. The minimum value of $t_1$ in milliseconds such that there is no transient in the voltage across the 100 $\mu F$ capacitor, is \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} (Round off to 2 decimal places) \hfill (GATE EE 2023)
